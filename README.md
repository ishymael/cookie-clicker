# cookie-clicker
Welcome to Cookie Clicker, a nostalgic childhood game I've recreated where each click brings you closer to nausea. This is my first ever game created using purely JS DOM Manipulation and I'm thrilled about it. Of course I had to enhance it with an online-sourced timer for an added challenge. Feel free to contribute :)
